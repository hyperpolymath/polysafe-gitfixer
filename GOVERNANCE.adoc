== Overview

polysafe-gitfixer is governed by principles of transparency, consensus-seeking,
and graduated trust. This document describes how decisions are made and how
contributors can participate in project governance.

== Core Principles

=== Consensus-Seeking

We prefer consensus over voting. Decisions should emerge from discussion
where possible, with voting reserved for deadlocks.

=== Graduated Trust

The Tri-Perimeter Contribution Framework (TPCF) provides graduated access
based on demonstrated expertise and commitment.

=== Reversibility

Decisions should be reversible when practical. We prefer experiments over
permanent commitments.

=== Transparency

All governance discussions happen in public, with decisions documented
in issues or merge requests.

=== Merit-Based

Advancement is based on contributions and demonstrated judgment, not
tenure alone.

== Tri-Perimeter Framework

See link:CONTRIBUTING.adoc[CONTRIBUTING] for detailed framework description.

== Decision-Making

=== Decision Categories

==== Routine Decisions

* Typo fixes, documentation improvements
* Clear bug fixes with tests
* Approved by any maintainer

==== Minor Decisions

* Feature additions within existing architecture
* Dependency updates (non-breaking)
* Requires review from one core maintainer

==== Major Decisions

* New components or languages
* Breaking changes to public APIs
* Significant architectural changes
* Requires discussion period (1 week) and approval from 2+ maintainers

==== Critical Decisions

* Security-critical changes
* License modifications
* Governance changes
* Requires supermajority (2/3) of active maintainers

=== Voting Process

When consensus cannot be reached:

1. Discussion period of at least 72 hours
2. Clear proposal documented in an issue
3. Voting period of 1 week
4. Each active maintainer gets one vote
5. Results documented publicly

== Project Roles

=== Community Contributor

* Anyone who participates in discussions or reports bugs
* No special permissions required

=== Regular Contributor

* Has submitted multiple accepted contributions
* Demonstrates understanding of project goals
* May be invited to review PRs

=== Trusted Contributor (Perimeter 2)

* Requirements:
** 3+ months active participation, OR
** 10+ merged contributions, OR
** Demonstrated domain expertise
* Responsibilities:
** Review and approve merge requests
** Mentor new contributors
** Help with issue triage

=== Core Maintainer (Perimeter 1)

* Requirements:
** Sustained high-quality contributions
** Demonstrated good judgment
** Nominated by existing maintainer, approved by consensus
* Responsibilities:
** Merge to protected branches
** Release management
** Security response
** Final say on architectural decisions
* Listed in MAINTAINERS.md

== Security Governance

=== Security Team

Core maintainers form the security response team.

=== Response Process

1. Vulnerability reported via SECURITY.md channels
2. Acknowledged within SLA timeframe
3. Assessed and assigned severity
4. Fix developed in private
5. Coordinated disclosure

=== Emergency Authority

In critical security situations, any core maintainer may:

* Revert commits
* Disable features
* Push emergency patches

Such actions must be documented immediately and reviewed by the team
within 24 hours.

== Release Management

=== Versioning

We follow Semantic Versioning (SemVer):

* MAJOR: Breaking changes
* MINOR: New features, backward compatible
* PATCH: Bug fixes, backward compatible

=== Release Process

1. Feature freeze announced
2. Release candidate prepared
3. Testing period (1 week for major, 3 days for minor)
4. Release notes drafted
5. Tag created and release published
6. Announcement posted

=== Release Schedule

* Patch releases: As needed
* Minor releases: Quarterly
* Major releases: When necessary, with migration guides

== Conflict Resolution

=== Technical Disagreements

1. Discussion in relevant issue/MR
2. Seek input from domain experts
3. If unresolved, escalate to core maintainers
4. If still unresolved, vote

=== Code of Conduct Violations

See link:CODE_OF_CONDUCT.adoc[CODE OF CONDUCT] for enforcement procedures.

=== Maintainer Disputes

1. Private discussion between involved parties
2. Mediation by uninvolved maintainer
3. If unresolved, vote by all other maintainers

== Succession Planning

=== Bus Factor Mitigation

* No single maintainer should have exclusive knowledge
* Critical systems documented in docs/
* Multiple maintainers for each component

=== Maintainer Transitions

When a maintainer steps down:

1. Knowledge transfer period (if possible)
2. Update MAINTAINERS.md
3. Credential rotation
4. Public acknowledgment

=== Project Archival

If the project becomes unmaintained:

1. Clear announcement with 90-day notice
2. Fork recommendations documented
3. Archive repository (read-only)
4. Preserve issue history

== Amendment Process

=== Minor Amendments

* Clarifications, typo fixes
* Single maintainer approval

=== Major Amendments

* Structural changes to governance
* Process:
1. Proposal issue created
2. 2-week discussion period
3. 2/3 supermajority vote required
4. 1-week implementation period

== Financial Governance

=== Transparency

If the project receives funding:

* All income and expenses documented
* Quarterly reports published
* OpenCollective or similar transparent platform preferred

=== Spending Authority

* Under $100: Any maintainer
* $100-$500: Two maintainer approval
* Over $500: Majority maintainer approval

=== Budget Priorities

1. Infrastructure and hosting
2. Security audits
3. Contributor compensation
4. Community events
5. Upstream support

== Platform Governance

=== Primary Platform

GitLab (gitlab.com/Hyperpolymath/polysafe-gitfixer)

=== Mirrors

GitHub mirror maintained for discoverability.

=== Credentials

* Access credentials documented securely
* Rotation on maintainer departure
* 2FA required for all maintainers

== Contact

For governance questions, open an issue or contact maintainers listed
in MAINTAINERS.md.
